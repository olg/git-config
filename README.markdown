# git-config

This is my personal git configuration. There's nothing too interesting in here. I'll highlight interesting parts in comments.

Having a global ignore file is extremely useful - it means you dont have to care if someone didn't bother to include a .gitignore file in their repository. However it also means you forget to include a .gitignore in yours!

If you want to use this configuration edit the files to make personal and move these files to `~/.config/git`.
